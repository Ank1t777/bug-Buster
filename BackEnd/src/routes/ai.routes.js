import express from 'express';

    const { prompt } = req.body;

    // Simulate AI response (replace this with your actual AI logic)
    const suggestion = `
**Here's an improved version of your code:**

\`\`\`javascript
/**
 * Sums two numbers.
 * @param {number} a The first number.
 * @param {number} b The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
 */

Now your function is more reusable and includes proper documentation! ðŸ˜Š`;
